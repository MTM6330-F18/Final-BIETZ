          <div class="teacherBio">
            <p>My name is Michael Eisenbraun and I am currently a part-time professor at Algonquin
              College for the Interactive Media and Design program. I teach Client-Side Web Development in Level 2 and
              Server-Side Web Development in Level 3.

              I am largely self-taught and constantly striving to learn more. The field of web design and development
              is
              ever-changing and if you don’t keep moving, you will fall behind. It is this realization that led me to
              start
              teaching at Algonquin College in January of 2016. I have a passion for learning and it fuels my desire to
              share what I know with others. It has become my new passion and my primary focus. I aim to be the best
              teacher I can, and it is my hope that my students will find the same spark of curiosity that changed my
              life
              all those years ago.

              Many students who join the IMD program, do so for the video and design. So they are often caught off
              guard
              by
              the amount of programming required. While I don’t expect students to have prior programming experience, I
              would like perspective students to know that programming is taught in IMD and that they don’t have afraid
              of
              it. Anyone can learn to program if they are willing to try.</p>
