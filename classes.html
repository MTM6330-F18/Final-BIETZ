          entirely online, or in a hybrid mode which combines classroom sessions
          with online learning activities. Upon registration, each full-time
          student is provided an Algonquin email account which is used to

                Students are introduced to DSLR cameras and taken beyond simply
                pointing and clicking. By using manual modes and taking
                advantage of the many features a DSLR camera has to offer,
                students learn the technology, techniques, and theory of
                photography and video through a hands-on approach. By exploring
                best practices during production, students learn to avoid
                post-production issues.

                Students learn the full video production life cycle, from
                planning and pre-production, to editing and post-production.
                Video and audio technology and tools are introduced, building on
                the techniques and best practices developed through DSLR
                photography. Students practise working through pre-production
                and production of both video and audio, ensuring the best
                quality result when transitioning to post-production to limit
                the amount of correction needed during the editing process.
